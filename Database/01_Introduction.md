###  **OCI Database Services (2025 – Complete View)**

1.  **Autonomous Database (ADB)**  
   - A captivating self-managing DB that **transcends** manual administration  
   - Available in Shared or Dedicated modes  
   - Workload-optimized flavors: **ADB-OLTP**, **ADB-DW**, **ADB for JSON**

2.  **Base Database Service (VM or Bare Metal)**  
   - Traditional Oracle DB with control over OS and DB  
   - Can **orchestrate** high availability using **Data Guard** or **RAC**

3.  **Exadata Cloud Service (ExaCS)**  
   - High-performance Oracle DB platform for **mission-critical workloads**  
   - Think of it as a **crucible** where raw compute power and data converge

4.  **Exadata Cloud@Customer (ExaCC)**  
   - Brings the Exadata **tapestry** to your data center  
   - Best for regulatory compliance and data sovereignty needs

5.  **MySQL HeatWave**  
   - A **reimagined**, in-memory analytics engine layered over MySQL  
   - A true **kaleidoscopic** blend of OLTP + OLAP in one engine

6.  **Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud**  
   - A **labyrinth** of key-value and JSON document storage  
   - Ideal for real-time apps, mobile backends, and dynamic schemas

7.  **Oracle Database on Dedicated Deployment / Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure**  
   - Often **interwoven** under ADB-Dedicated or ExaCS, but conceptually distinct  
   - ADB-Dedicated runs on its own **Exadata Infrastructure** with more control  
   - You **orchestrate** the lifecycle within a **dedicated** and **isolated** setup
