# **Redo Logs** : how they work in Oracle databases and why they are important for high availability and recovery.

## What is a Redo Log in Oracle Database?

### **Definition:**
A **Redo Log** is a set of files in an Oracle Database that **records all changes made to the database**, including **inserts, updates, deletes, and DDL commands**. This log ensures that even if a system crashes, **you can recover the data** that was changed but not yet permanently saved (committed) to the data files.

In simple words, **Redo Logs are a change tracker** for everything that happens inside the database.

## Why Redo Logs Are Important

1. **Crash Recovery:**  
   If the database crashes unexpectedly, Oracle uses redo logs to replay any changes that were in memory but not written to the disk.

2. **Data Guard & Replication:**  
   Redo logs are used to **replicate changes** from the primary database to the standby database in Oracle Data Guard.

3. **Backup & Recovery:**  
   Redo logs play a critical role in **point-in-time recovery** during backup restoration.

## How It Works

Imagine this scenario:

1. A user updates a record in the database.
2. Oracle **writes this change to memory (buffer cache)**.
3. At the same time, it writes the **change into the Redo Log**.
4. Periodically, Oracle writes changes from memory to the actual data files.

If the system crashes before writing to the data files, Oracle can use the redo log to reapply those changes during recovery.

## Redo Log Types

Oracle uses two types of redo logs:

1. **Online Redo Logs:**
   - Actively used by the database during operations.
   - Stored in redo log files on disk.
   - Usually multiple files grouped in a rotation (log group).

2. **Archived Redo Logs:**
   - These are **copies** of filled online redo logs.
   - Created when the database is in **ARCHIVELOG mode**.
   - Useful for **media recovery** and **Data Guard** replication.

## Redo Log Files

- Stored in **groups** (called Log Groups).
- Each group can have **multiple members** (for redundancy).
- Oracle writes in a **circular fashion** — when one log fills, it switches to the next.

Example:
- Log Group 1 → Log Group 2 → Log Group 3 → back to Log Group 1

## Use in Oracle Data Guard

In Oracle Data Guard:

- Redo logs on the **primary** database are used to send changes to the **standby** database.
- This is done through **Redo Transport Services**.
- On the standby side, those redo logs are applied to **keep it in sync** with the primary.

## Real World Analogy

Think of redo logs like a **flight recorder (black box)** in an airplane:
- It logs every action the pilot takes.
- If there is a crash, investigators can **replay** what happened.
- Similarly, redo logs allow Oracle to **replay database changes** during recovery.

| Feature          | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Redo Log         | Records all changes made to the database     |
| Online Redo Log  | Used for active transaction tracking         |
| Archived Redo Log| Used for recovery and Data Guard replication |
| Crash Recovery   | Replays changes using redo logs              |
| Data Guard       | Uses redo logs to sync primary and standby   |
