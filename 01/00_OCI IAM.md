# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Identity & Access Management (IAM) Tutorial

## **1. Introduction to OCI IAM**
Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a crucial service that allows administrators to control access to OCI resources. It provides authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) mechanisms to define who can access what resources and with what level of permissions.

### **Key IAM Features**
- Identity Domains
- Users, Groups, and Dynamic Groups
- Policies & Authorization
- Compartments
- Federation & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

## **2. IAM Core Concepts**

### **2.1 Authentication vs Authorization**
- **Authentication (AuthN):** The process of verifying a user's identity.
- **Authorization (AuthZ):** The process of defining what resources a user can access and what actions they can perform.

---

### **2.2 Identity Domains**
An **Identity Domain** is a container that manages users, groups, authentication settings, and security policies in OCI.

#### **Types of Identity Domains**
1. **Free Identity Domain** – Default identity domain in OCI.
2. **Oracle Apps Identity Domain** – Used for Oracle SaaS, PaaS applications.
3. **Oracle Apps Premium** – Supports hybrid IAM scenarios.
4. **Premium Identity Domain** – Provides full IAM feature set.
5. **External User Identity Domain** – Used for non-employee, consumer applications.

#### **Key Identity Domain Features**
- Federation Support
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- User and Role Management

---

### **2.3 Users, Groups & Dynamic Groups**
- **Users:** Individuals or systems that manage and interact with OCI resources.
- **Groups:** Collections of users with similar permissions.
- **Dynamic Groups:** Groups where membership is dynamically assigned based on conditions (e.g., a compute instance belongs to a specific compartment).

---

### **2.4 Compartments**
**Compartments** are logical constructs used for organizing OCI resources. They provide isolation and access control.

#### **Key Concepts of Compartments**
- **Root Compartment:** The top-level compartment automatically created when an OCI tenancy is set up.
- **Child Compartments:** Sub-compartments that help organize resources further.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Organize resources based on teams, departments, or projects.
  - Implement fine-grained access control using policies.

---

### **2.5 Policies & Authorization**
Policies define authorization rules using a human-readable syntax.

#### **Policy Syntax:**
```
Allow <group> to <verb> <resource-type> in <compartment>
```

#### **Policy Elements:**
1. **Subjects:** Groups or users being granted access.
2. **Verbs:** Actions allowed (Inspect, Read, Use, Manage).
3. **Resources:** The type of resource (e.g., `compute-instance`, `vcn`).
4. **Location:** The compartment where access is granted.
5. **Conditions:** Optional rules to refine policies further.

#### **Example Policies:**
- Allow network admins to manage all networking resources:
  ```
  Allow group NetworkAdmins to manage virtual-network-family in compartment Production
  ```
- Allow developers to read compute instances:
  ```
  Allow group Developers to read instance in compartment Dev
  ```

## **3. Federation & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

### **3.1 Federation**
Federation allows OCI IAM to delegate authentication to an external identity provider (IdP), such as Azure Active Directory.

#### **Key Federation Concepts**
- **Identity Provider (IdP):** The external service authenticating users.
- **Service Provider (SP):** OCI, which relies on IdP authentication.
- **SAML 2.0 Protocol:** The standard used for federating authentication.
- **Federation Trust:** The relationship established between OCI and an IdP.
- **Federated Users vs Local Users:**
  - **Federated Users:** Authenticate via an external IdP (e.g., Azure AD).
  - **Local Users:** Authenticate using OCI IAM credentials.

#### **Federation Process**
1. User tries to access OCI resources.
2. OCI redirects authentication to the identity provider.
3. User logs in through IdP.
4. IdP sends a SAML token back to OCI.
5. OCI grants access based on IAM policies.

### **3.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
MFA enhances security by requiring additional authentication steps beyond just a password.

#### **MFA Options in OCI:**
- TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) via an authenticator app.
- Email-based verification codes.
- SMS-based authentication.

## **4. Hands-on Labs**
### **Lab 1: Creating Users, Groups & Policies**
1. Navigate to OCI Console > Identity & Security > Users.
2. Create a new user (e.g., `JohnDoe`).
3. Navigate to Groups > Create a new group (`Developers`).
4. Add `JohnDoe` to the `Developers` group.
5. Create a new policy:
   ```
   Allow group Developers to use instance-family in compartment Dev
   ```
6. Verify access by logging in as `JohnDoe`.

### **Lab 2: Creating and Managing Compartments**
1. Go to OCI Console > Identity & Security > Compartments.
2. Create a new compartment (`Production`).
3. Move or create resources inside this compartment.
4. Apply policies to restrict access to the compartment.

### **Lab 3: Configuring Federation with Azure AD**
1. Go to OCI Console > Identity > Federation.
2. Select "Create Identity Provider" and choose "Azure AD".
3. Upload the SAML metadata XML file from Azure AD.
4. Test authentication via federated login.

## **5. Summary & Best Practices**
### **Best Practices for IAM in OCI**
- Follow **least privilege principle** when defining IAM policies.
- Use **compartments** for proper resource organization.
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all users.
- Regularly review **audit logs** for unusual activity.
- Use **Federation** with enterprise IdPs for centralized authentication.

### **Next Steps**
- Explore **OCI CLI** and **Terraform for IAM automation**.
- Prepare for **OCI Certified Architect exams**.
- Implement **advanced IAM security strategies**.
